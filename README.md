## Improvements
-  Add a show/hide icon inside the password input to ensure the user's privacy during the password creation.
- Add a requirement with a minimum of characters.
- Add a toggle switch for which requirements the user wants to check their password. With that, the user won't need to change the application.
- Create a password strength bar.
- Create a reset button to erase the text input.
- Create a copy password button.
